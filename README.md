#### K-Means Segmentation Problem and Denoise Problem.
#### Objective Given:
1. The goal of this task is to segment image using k-means clustering.
2. The goal of this task is to denoise image using median filter.

#### Tasks performed:
1. Implemented the K-Means Algorithms without using any pre-defined libraries in pyhton. The main challenge faced was to reduce the computational time which was done by skipping similar intensity cells.
2. Performed median filtering of am image.


##### Issues:
The code works for K=2 and provides results in about 500 secs.
