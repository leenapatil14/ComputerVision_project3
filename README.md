# ComputerVision_project3
##Computer Vision class project
The goal of the project is to implement K-Means Clustering algorithm from scrtach without the use of any numpy or orther libraries.
It also involves use implementing Median Filtering 

The main challenge faced was to reduce the computational time which was done by skipping similar intensity cells.

The code works for K=2 and provides reults in about 500 secs.
